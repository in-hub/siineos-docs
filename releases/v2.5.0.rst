InCore
------

* Foundation:

* CloudOfThings:
    - CloudOfThingsMeasurementWriter: refactoring to use MeasurementBufferDatabase and a more lightweight API
* Database:
    - Database: added ``ready`` property
    - DatabaseQuery: defer execution until the ``ready`` property of the attached database table is ``true``
    - DatabaseQuery, DatabaseSqlQuery: reset ``error`` before executing query

* IO:
    - AlphasenseOpcN3, SensirionHDLC, SensirionSPS30: handle dynamic changes of the ``portName`` property at runtime 
    - AlphasenseOpcN3, SensirionHDLC: don't send requests if the ``portName`` property is empty

    - LED: added ``systemName`` property
    - LED: added support for configuring triggers via the new ``trigger`` property, the ``networkInterfaceName`` property and the ``Trigger`` enumeration
    - SensirionHDLC: refactoring to handle different types of Sensirion sensors generically
    - SensirionSFM3300: added new object for the Sensirion SFM3300 mass flow meter
    - SerialPortBus: added check for non-empty port name before opening serial port
    - SerialPortBusNode: assign a valid instance to ``serialPort`` per default so basic parameters such as ``portName`` need to be set only
    - SerialPortBusNode: added ``portName`` alias property allowing to use ``Select`` easily
