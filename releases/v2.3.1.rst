InCore
------

* Foundation:
    - DataObject: update ``data`` before emitting the ``timestampChanged()`` signal 
    - Gather: improved ``typeFilter`` to better handle different inheritance cases for QML objects
    - IoDevice: added missing activation of ``isOpenChanged()`` signal
    - JsonRpcClient: added support for JS callbacks to all methods to replace previous callback-like signals
    - MobileNetworkInterface: added ``authenticationType`` property
    - MobileNetworkInterface: added ``deviceManufacturer`` property
    - MobileNetworkInterface: prefer IPv4+IPv6 configuration over IPv6 or IPv4 only
    - MobileNetworkInterface: refactored connection/bearer management for better reliability and performance
    - MobileNetworkInterface: added support for sending SMS to multiple numbers in one call
    - NetworkInterface: added ``routes`` property and new ``NetworkRoute`` object
    - NftFlow: fixed broken handling of the ``protocol`` property
    - TcpServer: added initial implementation
* IO:
    - Keyboard, KeyboardManager: refactored device management and fixed permission issue
    - UsbPrinter: added initial implementation
* Mqtt:
    - MqttTopic: explicitely convert received MQTT message to ``data`` property if ``dataType`` property is set (e.g. the string ``"false"`` is not treated as a "non-null" value and therefore no longer evaluates to ``true`` if ``dataType`` is ``MqttTopic.Boolean``)

    - Integrated ``WebSocket`` and ``Counter`` objects
    - Integrated all changes from InCore.Foundation and InCore.Mqtt
    - Integrated latest fixes and backports for the underlying Qt 5.15 libraries
